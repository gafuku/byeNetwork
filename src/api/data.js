    longBio:
      "Jay'Shun's vision for the Black Youth Empowerment Network (BYEN) stems from his own struggles with racial disparities, academic setbacks, and lack of community support. Growing up, he faced limited opportunities and environments that weren't designed for his success. Despite this, he realized the importance of a supportive network and resources. This led him to create BYEN—a space where young Black leaders, entrepreneurs, and creatives can find the guidance and support he lacked. BYEN is a movement focused on leadership, entrepreneurship, and creative expression, committed to ensuring the next generation doesn't face these challenges alone.",
    empowermentQuote: "To me, empowering Black youth means equipping them with the tools, support, and belief they need to lead without limits. It means making sure we are not just speaking about potential — we are investing in it. Empowerment is about access, visibility, and community — giving young Black leaders the space to rise, the resources to grow, and the network to thrive. Here at BYEN, we don't just talk about it — we do it.",
